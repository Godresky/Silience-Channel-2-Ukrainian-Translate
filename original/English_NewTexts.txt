>Daddy was so angry when he came home from work today!
When I took Teddy to him to play, he yelled at me and threw Teddy aside. After that, mommy took me to my room hugged me, and told me not to leave the room.
I can hear Mom and Dad shouting at each other outside...</Entry>

>Doctor, I hope you are doing well.
I wanted to talk to you about Martin's behavior,
but you weren't at the office, so I left you a note.
Martin is so anxious these days and is getting worse day by day. He told me that you changed his previous pills and prescribed new ones.
I wanted to make sure that these pills are not the cause of these behaviors. Please let me know.

>I love my wife and daughter, but they don't love me anymore,
I'm afraid to lose them. We were happy together until I started to hear these voices in my head! When I hear the voices,
Alessa just screams and Rose doesn't listen to me at all.
I beg them not to scream but they don't care. I love my wife and daughter and no matter what,
I'm not letting anything tear us apart.

They're not allowed to leave me.
They must stay with me forever...</Entry>
