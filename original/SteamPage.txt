Woke up to a strange sound and opened my eyes. Sitting in my bed, confused and shocked, I looked at the partly open door. Someone with strange eyes was staring at me through the door,
suddenly the door closed! I came to and realized that someone had sneaked into my house. All I could think of at that moment was to call the police, that is, if everything is in its place.
Am I to try this maze on my own or will someone help me out?

Silence Channel is a series of Psychological Horror video games based on true stories, each episode of which tells its own unique story and character development. In Silence Channel 2,
players need to solve puzzles, hide from enemies, find hidden items, and even fight with strange creatures in order to unravel the story and escape from the environments they are trapped in.

The story of this episode is also based on a true story. At the beginning of the game, we are introduced to an unknown character who witnesses strange and supernatural events in her house and does
everything she can to escape from it. Then we hear a phone call report from a woman to the police stating that someone has entered her house and she needs help. At this time, an officer named John Martin,
who is the closest patrol officer to the house, is dispatched to investigate the scene, and a new story begins.
