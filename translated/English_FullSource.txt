-Female >On Halloween of 1989, the wife &amp; daughter of Officer Martin Fisher, a member of the area police force,  suspiciously were murdered at their home. Martin,  who wasn't at home at that time,  claimed that he noticed a strange clown smiling at him around the house when he returned home!</Entry>

-Female >Five years later ,  a young woman called the police and claimed that someone had entered her house. 
Martin as the closest patrol officer went there to check the situation.
After hearing the sound of gunshots from the house, the backup forces went there and found the body of a young lady at the top of the entrance stairs, who had been shot by Martin's weapon! Martin claimed after entering the house strange things happened to him,  while checking the house, a clown attacked him, and he shot that clown,
not anyone else.</Entry>

-Female >Currently, I had more than 16 psychiatric sessions with Martin, the results of which are included in his file,
but according to my sessions with Martin, to be honest, something, in this case, has preoccupied my mind.
What if something really happened to Martin? what if something supernatural is hidden in this case?</Entry>

-Female >I don't know if what I'm trying to do is right or not. But I want to live in that house for a short time.</Entry>
